# Odin JavaScript Projects
I've decided to make a single repository for all of my future projects for the Odin's "JavaScript" course.
This way I plan on connecting them through a single index and try to use a single general stylesheet for various projects to limit repeating myself.
I also want to use this as an opportunity to practice using JSLint and Prettier.
